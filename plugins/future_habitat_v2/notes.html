	Current Tidal Marsh Areas:   Maine Natural Areas Program, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 2015.  Locations of tidal marshes in Maine as mapped by the Maine Natural Areas Program, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry. Data are mapped at 1:24K or larger scale.  The minimum mapping unit for tidal marshes was 5 acres though most, but not all marshes between 2.5 and 5 acres were also included.

	Future Habitat / Marsh Migration Data:  Maine Natural Areas Program, Maine Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Forestry 2015.  Low lying areas of the non-tidal landscape that are adjacent to tidal estuaries that could be inundated at highest annual tide if sea level is increased by 1 foot, 2 feet, 3.3 feet, and 6 feet.  These are areas where existing tidal marshes could migrate or expand given corresponding increases in sea level.  This data covers the entire Maine coastline.
