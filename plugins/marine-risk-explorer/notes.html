			<b>1. Seal Level Rise:</b>
			This dataset approximates the inland extent of several scenarios (1, 2, 3.3 or 6 feet) of sea level rise or storm surge along the Maine coastline on top of the 2015 Highest Annual Tide, or HAT. That HAT layer displays the maximum predicted astronomical high tide for 2015. The data were developed using a static (“bathtub”) inundation model that uses LiDAR topographic data as a base digital elevation model, and first adjusts HAT tidal predictions to take into account variability in the water surface elevations along the Maine coastline, and then adds scenarios of 1, 2, 3.3, and 6 feet of either storm surge or sea level rise to that initial starting elevation. The primary purpose of these data is to help inform storm surge and sea level rise vulnerability assessments.

			<b>2. Address points:</b>
			Maine E911 data set developed by the Maine Public Utilities Commission to implement the Next Generation 911 project in Maine shows point locations for addressable structures and other landmark locations such as ballparks, cemeteries, boat launches, etc.  For more information: <a href="https://geolibrary-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maine-e911-addresses">https://geolibrary-maine.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/maine-e911-addresses</a>.
			Inaccessible Address Points. Address points that could be inaccessible to Emergency Management Service stations at highest annual tide if sea level is increased by 1 foot, 2 feet, 3.3 feet and 6 feet. These are address points that area adjacent to Inaccessible Roads.

			<b>6. Inundated Roads</b>		
			Road section of the Maine E911 road data set that could be inundated at highest annual tide if sea level is increased by 1 foot, 2 feet, 3.3 feet and 6 feet. These are areas that may be covered by water and therefore not passable.
		</div>
		<div class="note">
			<b>7. Inaccessible Roads:</b>
			Road section of the Maine E911 road data set that could be inaccessible at highest annual tide if sea level is increased by 1 foot, 2 feet, 3.3 feet and 6 feet. These are areas that area adjacent to inundated roads and not accessible to emergency responders from the nearest Emergency Management Service station.
