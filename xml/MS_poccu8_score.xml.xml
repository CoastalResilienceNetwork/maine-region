			<abstract>Oyster restoration projects can provide social and economic benefits to those communities whose livelihoods depend most upon the health of coastal natural resources. We used 2000 census data that had been produced by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration through the National Ocean Service (NOS)â€™ Special Project (SP) Office to calculate and map the percentage of the workforce employed in agriculture, forestry, and fishing per census block group to identify coastal communities with high levels of natural resource job dependence. Nearshore areas (within 2km of shore) adjacent to block groups with high concentrations of workers employed in natural resource dependent sectors were scored 1 while areas adjacent to medium concentrations received a score of 0.5. High concentration was defined as 4-7% employed and medium concentration was defined as 1-3% employed. All remaining areas were scored 0. Scored polygons were converted to a 10m, 10m grid.</abstract>
			<purpose>In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010, The Nature Conservancy in collaboration with multiple partners including NOAA, the University of Southern Mississippi, Stanford University, and ESRI, has developed an online web mapping application and robust Gulf of Mexico spatial database to help facilitate restoration and recovery decisions. Primarily targeted to help our state programs and the state agencies and partners they work with, the Gulf Restoration Decision Support project is being advanced to inform the identification of oyster reef restoration projects with maximum ecological, social and economic benefits. The Oyster Restoration Dashboard allows users to explore this database to identify potential restoration investments within each of the Gulf states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. The Oyster Restoration Dashboard is organized by state and permits users to easily visualize locations most appropriate for oyster restoration investment using a suite of ecological, social and economic criteria. The suitability criteria vary somewhat between states due to differences in data availability, however all states include basic ecological measures such as depth, salinity and historic oyster distribution.</purpose>
