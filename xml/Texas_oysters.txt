  Description:
    Abstract:
    To address the issues of concern, and in response to the requirements
    of the Coastal Coordination Act, the Coastal Coordination Council has
    designated Oyster Reefs as a coastal natural resource area requiring
    special management under the Coastal Management Program and defined as
    Natural or artificial formations in intertidal or subtidal areas that
    are composed of oyster shell, live oysters, and other organisms and
    that are discrete contiguous, and clearly distinguishable from scatter-
    ed oysters.  Oyster reefs not only support the oyster fishery but also
    serve as habitat, forage ground, or hiding places for numerous
    estuarine species.

    Purpose:
    The oysters data set is a compilation of three data sets.  The first
    data set was developed by Dr. Eric Powell of Texas A&M University's
    Department of Oceanography under the auspices of the Galveston Bay
    National Estuary Program.  The reefs were mapped using acoustic
    equipment designed to return echo signal from the bay bottom.  In
    very shallow areas where a smaller boat was used, it was not
    possible to hang the equipment over the side of the boat; therefore
    a poling technique was used to determine the location of the oyster
    reefs.  The second and third data sets were both acquired from the
    Texas Parks and Wildlife Department.  One was developed by a team
    led by Warren Pulich and used aerials circa 1989.  The other was
    developed by Betsi Blair which also used aerial photographs and
    surveyed submerged aquatic vegetation including oyster reefs.
