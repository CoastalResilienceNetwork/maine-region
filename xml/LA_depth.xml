Primarily targeted to help our state programs and the state agencies and partners they work with, the Gulf Restoration Decision Support project is being advanced to inform the identification of oyster reef restoration projects with maximum ecological, social and economic benefits. The Oyster Restoration Dashboard allows users to explore this database to identify potential restoration investments within each of the Gulf states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas.The Oyster Restoration Dashboard is organized by state and permits users to easily visualize locations most appropriate for oyster restoration investment using a suite of ecological, social and economic criteria. The suitability criteria vary somewhat between states due to differences in data availability, however all states include basic ecological measures such as depth, salinity and historic oyster distribution.Oysters are able to thrive at a variety of depths, however, for the objectives of this project, the depth of placement was restricted to a maximum of 10 feet. All areas 10ft deep or less were scored 1 with remaining areas scored 0. The scored raster was resampled to a 500, 500m grid. Original data source: NOAA Bathymetry of Texas-Louisiana Continental Shelf and Coastal Regions (Digital Vector Data) compiled by Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. (1930-2005).</abstract><purpose>Oysters are able to thrive at a variety of depths, however, for the objectives of this project, the depth of placement was restricted to a maximum of 10 feet.
