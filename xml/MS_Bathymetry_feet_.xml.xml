			<abstract>This dataset was derived from bathymetry for Mississippi Sound, which was produced by NOAA's Ocean Service, Special Projects (SP) and downloaded from http://estuarinebathymetry.noaa.gov/. The purpose of this dataset was to convert the origional dataset from meters to feet in order to depict bathymetric contours in 5 foot intervals.Bathymetry for Mississippi Sound was derived from thirty-three surveys containing 371,210 soundings. Five overlapping, older, less accurate surveys were omitted before tinning. The average distance between soundings was 89 meters. The thirty-three surveys used dated from 1960 to 1979. The range of soundings for the surveys used was 0.8 meters to -17.6 meters at mean low water. A mean high water value of 0.5 meters was assigned to the shoreline. Twenty-five points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding points. These were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676).Mississippi Sound has forty-four 7.5 minute DEMs and three one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C-record).The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete.Purpose: Bathymetric DEM's can be used as layers in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) for earth science analysis. DEM's can also serve as tools for volumetric analysis, for site location of structures, or for drainage basin delineation. The source soundings are collected by the NOS Office of Coast Survey (OCS).</abstract>
			<purpose>In response to the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in April 2010, The Nature Conservancy in collaboration with multiple partners including NOAA, the University of Southern Mississippi, Stanford University, and ESRI, has developed an online web mapping application and robust Gulf of Mexico spatial database to help facilitate restoration and recovery decisions. Primarily targeted to help our state programs and the state agencies and partners they work with, the Gulf Restoration Decision Support project is being advanced to inform the identification of oyster reef restoration projects with maximum ecological, social and economic benefits. The Oyster Restoration Dashboard allows users to explore this database to identify potential restoration investments within each of the Gulf states of Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas. The Oyster Restoration Dashboard is organized by state and permits users to easily visualize locations most appropriate for oyster restoration investment using a suite of ecological, social and economic criteria. The suitability criteria vary somewhat between states due to differences in data availability, however all states include basic ecological measures such as depth, salinity and historic oyster distribution.</purpose>
