The suitability criteria vary somewhat between states due to differences in data availability, however all states include basic ecological measures such as depth, salinity and historic oyster distribution.</abstract><purpose>The purpose of this dataset is to depict locations most appropriate for oyster restoration. Oysters are likely to be successful in areas where they historically have been productive. However, it is important to note that conditions may have changed in the given time span such that restoration may not be suitable in all of the areas identified by this layer. To identify areas where oysters have been or are currently found, multiple current and historic oyster reef data sets were collated and merged. Areas with reef were scored 1 and all remaining areas were scored a 0. The scored polygons were converted to a 500m, 500m grid.
